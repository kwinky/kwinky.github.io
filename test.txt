Please provide a plan to create a single page website where the user takes a photo of a food menu (say at a restaurant) and then uses gemini to analyse which of the items on the menu would likely be suitable for someone with a particular dietary requirement. Please suggest the gemini model, prompt and way of calling gemini to limit the number of requests/tokens required. Suggest a plan for the appropriate ux for asking the user for their dietary requirements and then providing the details back to the user, such as annotating the image to cross out the food items that are likely to be unsuitable, placing a warning sign next to those that need to be checked with the waitstaff and a tick next to those items that are very likely to be suitable. Vercel/postgeMySQL native tools and next.js as the development environment. Structure the plan so that the product prototype is built incrementally starting with a "hello world" and then small testable increments using playwright (eg, an MVP each phase). The website should be mobile-first and use best practice UX designs.
